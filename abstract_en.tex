The Volumetric Count is a method used to quantify the amount of vehicles transiting on certain way, during a known period of time. This information is important due to the fact that its results can be used for economical studies, highway design and traffic planing. In this document a method is proposed and validated to volumetrically count the vehicles on a way using computer vision. It differs from other approaches because it is simpler, taking advantage of software resources already available, and its results are similar to the ones acquired by more complex solutions. The performance index show that the method is very precise, with the best result Kappa index of 0.86.
