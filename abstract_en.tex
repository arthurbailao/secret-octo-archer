The Volumetric Count is a method used to quantify the amount of vehicles transiting on certain way, during a known period of time. This information is important due to the fact that its conclusions can be used to economical studies, highway projects and traffic planing. In this document it is proposed and validated a method to volumetrically count the vehicles on a way using computer vision. It is different from other approaches because it is simpler, taking advantage of software resources already available and its results are similar to the ones acquired by more complex solutions. The performance indices show that the method is very precise, with the best result Kappa index of 0.86.
